    <p>Dina,</p>
    <p>
      This should be the last message you receive from us. If you use your wits
      you should be able to deduce the correct order to delete the messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains only for me to tell you that the first message you should
      delete is Alice's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good luck!
      <br />
